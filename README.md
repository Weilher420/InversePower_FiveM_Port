# InversePower (FiveM port)
This port contains 2 pre-made settings, one for my [DriveV](https://github.com/Weilher420/DriveV_Fivem_port) port and the other is the basic setting made by ikt.

## How to Install
1. **Download** the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Weilher420/InversePower_FiveM_Port/releases) page.
2. **Extract** the files into your FiveM resources folder.
3. **Add** `DriveV` to your `server.cfg` file.
4. **Restart** your FiveM server to apply the changes.
